    Casey Higgins Travel Bucket List

    An overview of a few of the places I have visited, and places I dream of visiting in the future. As a previous competitive dancer, most of the traveling I have done has been in relation to dance events and competitions. Going forward, however, I would love to be able to travel to new places to simply explore and take it all in. Although my favorite vacations typically involve relaxing on the beach, there are other types of locations I would love to see, and though the list may not be entirely realistic, it is still fun to create. 
    
    Favorite Places Visited Munich, Germany Klagenfurt, Austria Vienna, Austria Venice, Italy Las Vegas, Nevada Cape May, New Jersey Bonita Springs, Florida Gatlinburg, Tennessee Boston, Massachusetts Chicago, Illinois
